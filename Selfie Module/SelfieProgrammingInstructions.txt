Selfie Module
1. Remove the Arduino board from the Selfie Module.
2. Connect the programming cable to the Arduino board (black wire is at right when orienting the board with the resistors at top).
3. Connect the red wire of the programming cable to the header where it is labeled "5" (three down from the top).  An wire with alligator clips may be required.
4. The COM port may have to be specified.  The port closest to the VGA connector worked best.
